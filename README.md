# Madoka Senpai / マドカ先輩 is a manga webscraper bot!?
Written in NodeJS using discord.js, cheerio, and request/request-promise. This bot started as just because I was bored and me and my friends' channel was lacking a bot that gets the information of the manga that we share; and so behold, I have created a new magical girl bot *Madoka Senpai* (**this is in no means an attempt to steal the character Madoka from PMMM)**, she will magically retrieve all the information about a manga you want for all your weeaboo needs.

# Introduction (Professionally)
This is web scraping bot, it tries to search an input manga from ?<manga-name> and then returns the data of the first index from the search query from MAL.

It's quite literally very easy to use, just replace manga-name in ?<manga-name> with the manga or what you think is a manga, and Madoka Senpai will do the rest, so you won't have to worry your gentle weeaboo mind with the task of looking it up yourself.

## Bug, Issues, and Features Reporting
Go and file one on this repo. I don't have time to create my own discord server for this bot for issues, too lazy.
